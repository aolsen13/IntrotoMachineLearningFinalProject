# Predicting Song Popularity Using Machine Learning

This project uses supervised machine learning techniques to predict a song's popularity score (0–100) based on its audio features such as danceability, energy, loudness, valence, tempo, and more. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, multiple regression models, and final evaluation.

This work was completed as the Final Project for the Machine Learning course (Fall 2025).

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to explore whether measurable audio features can predict a song’s popularity.  
This is a **regression problem**, and the notebook includes:

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Multiple machine learning models
- Performance comparison
- Feature importance analysis
- Final conclusions and insights

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains audio features for thousands of Spotify tracks, including:

- `danceability`
- `energy`
- `loudness`
- `speechiness`
- `acousticness`
- `instrumentalness`
- `liveness`
- `valence`
- `tempo`
- `duration_ms`
- **Target:** `popularity` (0–100)

**Note:**  
The dataset is not included in this repository due to size constraints.

## Goals

- Determine which audio features most strongly influence popularity  
- Compare regression models taught in the course  
- Evaluate models using RMSE, MAE, and R²  
- Identify the best-performing model  
- Provide insights for music analytics and recommendation systems
